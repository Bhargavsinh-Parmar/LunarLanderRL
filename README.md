 Lunar Lander Reinforcement Learning

This project demonstrates the implementation of a reinforcement learning agent that learns to navigate the Lunar Lander environment using PyTorch and Gymnasium.

 Introduction
The Lunar Lander environment, provided by Gymnasium, presents a challenging task where an agent must land a spacecraft on the moon's surface without crashing. In this project, we develop a reinforcement learning agent using PyTorch to learn the optimal strategy for successfully landing the lunar module.

 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bhargavsinh-Parmar/lunar-lander-rl.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd lunar-lander-rl
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 Usage
1. Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py
```
This will start the training process, and the agent will learn to navigate the Lunar Lander environment.

2. (Optional) To visualize the agent's performance, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
This will generate a video showing the agent's actions in the environment.

 Project Structure
- `train.py`: The main training script that runs the reinforcement learning algorithm.
- `agent.py`: Defines the Agent class, which includes the neural network architecture and the learning logic.
- `replay_memory.py`: Implements the replay memory to store and sample experiences during training.
- `utils.py`: Contains utility functions used throughout the project.

 Results
After training for 2000 episodes, the agent successfully learned to land the lunar module with an average score exceeding 200. The learning progress can be visualized by running the `evaluate.py` script.

 Future Improvements
- Experiment with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters to improve the agent's performance.
- Implement prioritized experience replay to focus on important experiences during training.
- Explore other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as A3C or PPO, to compare their effectiveness in the Lunar Lander environment.
